<h1>CSRF attack</h1>
<em>Cross Site Request Forgery</em>
<p>This is a form of attack were the attacker benefits from a session already established by the user.</p>
<p>The images below appear to be broken, but in reality, they aren't really images. They contain links
    to sites where a user <em>could be</em> logged in - and trusted. If that user loads this page, bad things
    migth happen.</p>
<p>The first two "images" will try to delete user #2 from a hypothetic database on either localhost:8000 or security.dev
    (what applies to you depends on how you run the exercises).</p>
